  {
    question:"what does a website cost?",
    answer:"The typical customer seeking a website to represent their business usually invests approximately $25,000 with us. However, there are numerous variables involved in a website project. Do you already possess a professional brand? Will we be responsible for generating your content? Do you require photography services? Are we designing any marketing materials for you? Will you be conducting online product sales? Do you need any membership features? And many other inquiries that must be addressed in order to determine the cost. It is impossible to provide a price without establishing the project's scope, so we advise caution if anyone offers you a quote without first conducting a strategy call to understand your specific requirements. To begin determining the necessary investment, we suggest scheduling a call with our strategy team."
  },
  {
    question:"what is your hourly rate?",
    answer:"Our hourly support rate is $120 per hour, and we bill in increments of 1/4 hour, with a minimum of 1/2 hour per task. Invoices are issued at the end of each month. To qualify for our hourly support, your website must be in excellent condition by being on our website care plan. For complete projects, we offer fixed quotes based on a defined scope."
  },
  {
    question:"where are you located?",
    answer:"The entire team at Web Ambrosia operates remotely, working from their respective home offices. Our priority has been to assemble a team of talented individuals rather than restricting ourselves to a specific location. As a result, our team is spread all across the United States."
  },
  {
    question:"how long does it take to build a website?",
    answer:"Typically, a new website project will span a timeframe of 10-16 weeks. However, various factors can influence this duration, such as the project's scale, the availability of feedback from your end, content creation responsibilities, and whether we are also handling branding or similar tasks. Several factors that can impact the timeline include:   {'/n'}     Logo design   {'/n'}    Creation of a branding style guide   {'/n'}    Photography package  {'/n'}   Copywriting services  {'/n'}   E-commerce functionality   {'/n'}     Membership functionality   {'/n'}    Integration of third-party APIs  {'/n'}   Social media strategy   {'/n'}    Search Engine Optimization   {'/n'}    Google Adwords   {'/n'}    Client's prior involvement in website projects   {'/n'}    Client's availability for meetings, reviews, and feedback   {'/n'}    It's worth noting that Web Ambrosia observes a closure period of two to three weeks during the Christmas season. The good news is that we establish a timeline, scope, and cost for each project during our intake process. Additionally, we provide weekly email status reports at the beginning of each week, outlining the current project status and our upcoming tasks. Web Ambrosia is committed to maintaining the most effective process and communication among all web design agencies."
  },{
    question:"what if there additional features that need to be added in the middle of a project?",
    answer:" A comprehensive discovery process helps reduce the need for scope changes, although project priorities may shift during its execution. If any new functionality, design elements, or content are introduced that were not initially outlined in the agreement, it will usually necessitate adjustments to the budget and timeline. However, rest assured that we will reach a mutual agreement on any changes to the budget and timeline before initiating any additional work."
  },
  {
    question:"why is there such a large variation in website pricing?",
    answer:"A website, much like a house, car, or vacation, exhibits a broad spectrum of prices determined by the desired features, functionality, and level of refinement. Through an extensive one-hour discussion, we inquire about your specific requirements, enabling us to determine the precise elements necessary to deliver your ideal website and calculate the associated cost. During the initial phase of our process, we will provide you with a preliminary estimate for your project. Shortly thereafter, you will receive the exact price required to fulfill your project requirements."
  },
  {
    question:"are there any recurring costs for my website?",
    answer: "Our website Care Plans, priced at $107 per month, cover the hosting and maintenance of your website. Any additional features or support requests are addressed through our Support Services on an hourly basis."
